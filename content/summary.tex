\begin{frame}{Summary}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The Cherenkov Telescope Array is coming
		\item The pipeline ctapipe is being developed, big changes every once in a while
		\item We worked on adding features that worked well for FACT
		\item Number of islands improves gamma/hadron-separation
		\item FACT-cleaning works reasonably well but can't outperform the established method yet
		\item Potential improvements for cleaning: proper arrival times, finding optimal parameters
